Present your designs, professionally!



== Description ==

Normally you can never be sure if your client is viewing your designs properly. __Now you can take control over the presentation.__ With this plugin it's surprisingly easy to present your web designs the right way.

With the Mockup plugin __your customers__ can:

*   Approve the design.
*   Add feedback to your design.
*   See related designs quickly.
*   Read the description you made.

On the [website](http://www.mockupplugin.com) you can find [demo’s](http://www.mockupplugin.com/demos).




== Installation ==

1. Upload `Mockup` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Visit `Settings > Mockup` and adjust your configuration.




== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I get started? =

*Change the custom settings.* After the first installation you can change the settings to your wishes. Rename everything your client will see and control the layout (`MockUp -> Setting`) or (`Plugins -> MockUp -> Setting`).

*Make a customer.* This works the same as categories in posts. It links the mockups together.

*Make a page for the mockup.* Give the page a clear title (like: Home page or Blog). Add the MockUp and write a description. Then publish the page and you are done!


= I don't see MockUp in the admin menu! =

The normal position is on the bottom of the admin menu.
If you can’t find it there or you don’t want it there, change the menu position.

This can be done on the MockUp Settings page (`MockUp -> Setting`) or (`Plugins -> MockUp -> Setting`).


= I get a 404 page! =

This is a permalink problem. You can solve it by re-saving your permalinks. Go to `setting -> permalinks` then click on `Save changes`. That should fix it!


= My problem is not here! =

Go to the [support](http://www.mockupplugin.com/support) page and ask it.
