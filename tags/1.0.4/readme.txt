Mockup helps you to present your designs professionally to your customers.

== Description ==

Mockup is the perfect solution for any designer who wants to present his design(s) to a customer.

With the Mockup plugin your customers will have the possibility to:

*   Read your comments
*   Add remarks
*   Approve the design


It's possible to link all your designs to one customer. The customer will have a list of all the designs you made for him.

The buttons and popup come from Twitter Bootstrap.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `Mockup` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit 'Settings > Mockup' and adjust your configuration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a image? =

Adding a new mockup works the same as adding a new post or page.
After you did this you can use 'Featured Image' (<a href="http://www.screenr.com/q7c" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>) to add a Image.

= I get a 404 page =

This is a permalink problem. You can solve it by resaving your permalinks.
Go to setting -> permalinks then click on 'Save changes'. That should fix it!

== Screenshots ==

1. 1) How your customer will see the mockup. (I used the apple website as example)
2. 2) The admin page. Here you can rewrite all the text, change to header color en adjust your emailaddress.
3. 3) Adding a new mockup. (Use featured image to set your mockup.)
4. 4) List of your customers.
