The professional way to present your Web Designs!

== Description ==

Normally you can never be sure if your client is viewing your web designs properly. Now you can take control over the presentation. The first impression is the most important! With this plugin it is surprisingly easy to present your web designs the right way.

With the Mockup plugin your clients will have the possibility to:

*   Read your comments
*   Add remarks
*   Approve the design
*   See related designs quickly

The header, buttons and popup come from Twitter Bootstrap.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a image? =

Adding a new mockup works the same as adding a new post or page.
After you did this you can use 'Featured Image' to add a Image.

= I get a 404 page =

This is a permalink problem. You can solve it by resaving your permalinks.
Go to setting -> permalinks then click on 'Save changes'. That should fix it!
